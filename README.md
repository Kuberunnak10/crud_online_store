# crud_online_store
This is my first Django project that I'm working on.

To start, you must be logged in.

Using the "catalog" link, you can add, edit, delete and view the products that you add.

If you are not logged in, you can only view.

The product category is created in the admin panel. Ordinary users cannot do this.
